This project a proof-of-concept on using react-global-states - a shared/global state store, connecting multiple React components to the store and testing if
components react to the changes in the store.

### Start
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Type `showStates()` on browser console to see states any time.

Note: `showStates()` is not part of the library. It is just a helper for this demo.
